<p class="description">S<small>CENE</small>.—<i>Interior of an old Country Mansion;
door</i>, <small>C</small>.<i>; door</i>, <small>R</small>.<i>; door</i>
<small>L</small>.<i>; easy chairs; couch</i>, <small>L</small>.<i>; fire-place</i>,
<small>R</small>.<i>; clock</i>, <small>C</small>.<i>; chairs, &amp;c.; table</i>,
<small>R</small>., <i>on it a lighted lamp; closet at back</i>, <small>L</small>.</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. (<i>entering, door</i> <small>C</small>.) Yes, yes, godfather,
make your mind easy, you may sleep quietly on both sides of your face. (<i>advancing</i>)
That’s a saying in our parts; but I have tried it, and I couldn’t do it. (<i>looking at
clock</i>) Seven o’clock! what a litter this room is in. (<i>placing chairs, &amp;c.</i>)
And look here. (<i>indicating clothes scattered over an easy chair</i>) What’s all this?
Oh, old master’s morning gown. (<i>places it in the closet</i>) I have an idea that this
place of mine suits me very well. I am boarded and lodged and washed, eight pounds a year,
and the key of the cellar. I fancy I shall soon get my nose red in this house.
(<i>sits</i>) This here easy chair is uncommon comfortable.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. (<i>entering</i>, <small>C</small>. <i>door, a portmanteau in his
hand</i>) I don’t see a soul about. (<i>seeing</i> S<small>IMON</small>) Eh! halloa, my
friend! (<i>shaking him</i>) What are you doing there?</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. (<i>all aback</i>) Me, sir! I—I’m a doing my work.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Doing what?</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. (<i>rising</i>) What do you please to want?</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. I wish to see Mr. or Mrs. Mitchell.</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. Oh! either of them would do, then?</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. (<small>L</small>. <small>C</small>.) Yes.</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. (<small>R</small>. <small>C</small>.) That’s lucky, for they are
both gone out.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Out! then I will await their return.</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. I don’t think you will, sir.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. How do you mean?</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. Why, when master and missus went away this morning, they said
they were going on a visit, and should be away nine or ten days—and the same number of
nights too, no doubt.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. (<i>aside</i>) Pleasant information! all this distance from
London, and not a shilling in my pocket. (<i>to</i> S<small>IMON</small>) Are you alone
here?</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. Yes, I’m quite alone in the house, except my godfather, who lives
at the bottom of the garden.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. The surly old brute I met in the park?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. Yes, that’s godfather.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Agreeable society! Well, I must teach myself resignation.
(<i>offering portmanteau</i>) Go and prepare a chamber for me.</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. You are labouring under a mistake, sir; the Golden Lion is on the
other side of——</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Ah, true! you do not know me. I am Fra——(<i>checking himself</i>)
No, I mean Harry Mitchell, your master’s grandson.</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. Really! well, how lucky! I have a letter for your brother.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. For my brother Frank?</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. Yes, here it is. (<i>drawing a letter from his pocket</i>) I have
been ordered to post it.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. (<i>aside</i>) I know what are its contents—the old story—you are
a good-for-nothing fellow, and I shall not give you a sixpence. (<i>aloud, taking letter
and putting it into his pocket</i>) All right, I will take care he has it.</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. And so you are Master Harry, eh? You are the favourite, you
are.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. How did you learn that?</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. Godfather has made me acquainted with all the family matters, for
I am quite fresh, I am.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. You are quite fresh! what do you mean?</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. I mean I was quite new this morning. Godfather brought me here
and showed me to your grandmother just as she was stepping into the old family coach; she
had only just time to say, “Oh! this is the stupid animal you have told me about.” You
see, she is so old that she doesn’t always know what she is talking about.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. I think, though, her faculties were pretty clear this morning.
But, as you say, she is rather old—eighty-two. Considerably wrinkled, I should think.</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. Her face is just like a little apple that has been dried in the
sun.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. And my grandfather?</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. He is like a little pear that has been baked in an oven.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. I am certain I should not recognize them; they must be very dull
here, all by themselves.</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. Godfather says that they sometimes yawn till they get a lock-jaw;
that’s why they have just advertised in the papers for somebody to read to them.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Read to them!</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. Yes, a young lady.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. (<i>quickly</i>) Ah, there is a young lady here?</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. No, sir, she hasn’t come yet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. What a pity!</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. And they won’t want a young lady now they have engaged me.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. (<i>laughing</i>) But you are not a young lady.</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. No, and I can’t read, but——</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Idiot! go and prepare my chamber.</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. (<i>going</i>, <small>L</small>.) Yes, Master Harry.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Stop a moment; is there anything to eat in the pantry?</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. I saw the plate chest there; but I’ll go and see, Master Harry.
Ah! if you were Mr. Frank.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Well?</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. I shouldn’t be able to find anything. (<i>confidentially</i>)
Godfather says that you are a pet, and that your brother is a bad lot; old folks won’t
have him at any price.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. (<i>aside</i>) I know it but too well. (<i>aloud</i>) You will
find some cigars in my portmanteau, with my pipe and tobacco. Stay; have you got the keys
of the cellar?</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Then bring me some champagne.</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. I will. (<i>aside</i>) He’ll help me, I can see, to redden my
nose!</p>

<p class="direction_r"><i>Exit, with portmanteau, door</i>, <small>L</small>.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Have I done well to present myself here under my brother’s name,
because I know their great preference for him, and that they treat me like a Cinderella of
the male sex. This is the way I discovered that I was no favourite; one day I wrote to
them for money, and didn’t get it: while Harry, who had also written for some, did: then I
questioned myself as to what I had done, and as to what I had not done. I said to myself,
it is nearly twelve years since Harry and I quitted the old people; we are of the same
figure, considerably resemble each other; I could easily impose upon my grandmother, who
is nearly blind, and ditto upon my grandfather, who is quite deaf, and so I will go to
them and say here is your darling Harry, and express my willingness to receive as much
money as they choose to give me; if my brother were to write I should be there to suppress
his letters. Wasn’t that a clever idea? not particularly honest, but remarkably clever;
that will teach parents to have a preference, to all respectable grandfathers one grandson
is as good as another.</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> A<small>DELAIDE</small>, <i>door</i>, <small>C</small>.,
<i>a cloak over her arm, a small carpet bag in her hand.</i></p>

<p>A<small>DELAIDE</small>. Mrs. Mitchell, if you please, sir.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. (<small>L</small>. <small>C</small>.) Yes, this is her house, but
she is gone from home for nine or ten days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. (<small>R</small>. <small>C</small>.) How unfortunate! And Mr.
Mitchell?</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. That’s me. I am Mr. Mitchell; Fra——I mean Harry Mitchell.</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. (<i>aside</i>) Harry! It is he!</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Will you have the goodness to take a seat?</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. I thank you. But the Mr. Mitchell of whom I asked you is the
husband of Mrs. Mitchell, and I do not suppose that——</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. No, certainly; I have not married my grandmother, that sort of
thing is not allowed, you know. (<i>aside</i>) She is deucedly pretty. (<i>aloud</i>) Will
you have the goodness to take a seat?</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. Then your grandfather is also absent.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. For nine or ten days. I am quite alone here, but that makes no
difference. (<i>again offering chair</i>) Will you have the goodness to——</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. No, thank you. I believe I cannot do better than make my way back
to the railway station, and return to London. (<i>going up</i>)</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. (<i>following and bringing her back</i>) But, excuse me, may I be
allowed to enquire——</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. I believed I had been recommended to them by Mr. Dunstable, as a
companion to——</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Certainly, quite correct. (<i>aside</i>) She mustn’t go, I want a
companion, dreadfully. (<i>aloud</i>) They are expecting you, madam, very impatiently, I

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. Well, but, since they are not at home——</p>

be back directly; will you have the goodness to— (<i>taking a chair and seating himself
close beside her</i>)</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. (<i>shifting her chair, aside</i>) This Mr. Harry is very
forward. (<i>aloud</i>) And you think, sir, that I shall suit your grandmother?</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Certainly, you will suit her nicely—and you will suit my
grandmother capitally—and you will suit my grandfather capitally—and you suit me
beautifully—and you will suit my brother deli——</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. Ah, you have a brother?</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Yes, Harry—hem, no—I mean, Frank—I am Harry.</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. But, according to what Mr. Dunstable told me, one of you is a
very bad fellow.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. It isn’t me; I assure you, it’s my brother.</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. Are you quite certain?</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Quite certain that I am not my brother—oh, yes. But, after all,
Frank is really a capital fellow; he is, I assure <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"

little wild, but——</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. Pardon me, sir, but your grandmother does not return.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. She is taking a little walk in the park, and perhaps her corns
are troublesome—she has several, besides two or three bunions! but perhaps she has come in
and gone to bed—she is subject to—to—to the whooping cough——</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. The what, sir?</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. (<i>aside</i>) Confound it! I can’t think of—(<i>aloud</i>) I

the Golden Lion Hotel, which is near the railway station.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. (<i>again taking portmanteau from her hand</i>) No,
no—grandmother would be so angry—she has caused a chamber to be prepared for you.</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. Indeed!</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. The supper is ready, too. (<i>aside to</i> F<small>RANK</small>)
But, sir—</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. (<i>giving him a sly kick</i>) Be quiet!</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. (<i>taking her cloak and portmanteau from</i>
F<small>RANK</small>) I will go to my apartment. (<small>L</small>., <i>to</i>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Yes, you—make haste!</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. (<i>putting on morning gown</i>) Perhaps you are going to make me
a present of one like it, and want to see if it will fit.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Perhaps.</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. I’d rather have a coat, with nice long tails.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. (<i>hunting in closet</i>) Here, now put on this cap. (<i>giving
him morning cap</i>)</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. Well, but——</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. Don’t—I will!</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Now, muffle your face up—good—turn about, walk, not like that,
stoop—bend your back—that’s it! Now, where is grandmother’s chamber? (<i>seeing</i>

grandmother?</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. (<small>C</small>.) Don’t stir!</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. (<i>aside</i>) I know not why, but I felt frightened while in

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Miss—hem—miss—ah! here is my grandfather, he has just

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. (<i>making signs to</i> S<small>IMON</small>) Grandfather, this

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. (<i>astonished—to</i> F<small>RANK</small>) What, me!</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. (<i>aside—to him</i>) Hold your tongue, or I’ll break your back.
(<i>shouting</i>) The female companion. (<i>to</i> A<small>DELAIDE</small>) He is
dreadfully deaf; but that is not astonishing at his age—ninety-three—yes, I assure you, he
is ninety-three!</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. Oh! really, sir——</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Hold your tongue, or be killed! (<i>shouting</i>) You are very
tired, sit down, dear grandfather. (<i>to</i> A<small>DELAIDE</small>) The very shortest
walk fatigues him, and no wonder, for as I said before, he is ninety-seven,
and—(<i>pushing</i> S<small>IMON</small> <i>violently into easy chair</i>) Sit down, dear
grandfather! (<i>aside to him</i>) Sit down, you brute, and say your wife will be back

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. Very well, sir; I will wait.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. She is still in the park—grandfather’s legs are so weak—to say
nothing that he has the rheumatism; but, you know, an old soldier——</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. (<i>aside</i>) Now I am an old soldier!</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. Ah! your grandfather has served in——</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Certainly! (<i>to</i> S<small>IMON</small>) Grandfather, the
young lady asks if you have served. (<i>aside—to him</i>) Why don’t you answer?</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. Oh! yes, yes! I’m in service now!</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. (<i>punching him slyly</i>) You jackass!</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. What did he say?</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Oh! nothing—don’t mind him—he isn’t always quite right in his
head—rather idiotic sometimes.</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. Poor old gentleman.</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. (<i>aside</i>) Now I’m an idiot!</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. His great age, as I said before, ninety-nine, you know!
(<i>to</i> S<small>IMON</small>) As you say that grandmother is on her way home, you had
better go and meet her.</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. How! fatigued as he is, and at his age to go alone——</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Exactly! Surely, at his age, he is old enough to go alone!</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. No, no; go you, and I will stay here and bear your grandfather
company.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. (<i>aside</i>) The devil! leave them together. (<i>aloud</i>)
Why, you see——</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. I entreat you, the air is so chilly, and as he is suffering with
the rheumatism——</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Ah, true! (<i>shouting to</i> S<small>IMON</small>) Don’t stir!
this young lady will keep you company——</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. (<i>aside to</i> F<small>RANK</small>) And I shouldn’t at all
mind keeping company with her.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. (<i>punching him slyly</i>) Must I murder you?</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. No, you mustn’t.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. (<i>aside to him</i>) Mind that to everything she says, you
answer only, “My wife will be back directly.”</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. (<i>to</i> A<small>DELAIDE</small>) Now I’m off to fetch
grandmother.</p>

<p class="direction_r"><i>Exit</i>, <small>C</small>. <i>door.</i></p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. (<i>looking after</i> F<small>RANK</small>) That, then, is the
Mr. Harry of whom I have heard so much from my sister. He is not at all bad-looking; but
with all his good looks, he is a very worthless fellow.</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. (<i>coughing</i>) Hum! hum!</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. Oh! I was quite forgetting the old gentleman. (<i>going to</i>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. (<i>taking a pinch of snuff</i>) My wife will be back

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. There is a draught from this side—ah! this cushion. (<i>places a

pleasant to be old—atchieu! (<i>sneezing</i>)</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. Heaven bless you!</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. My wife will be back directly.</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. He is deaf as a post. (<i>to herself</i>) Yes, Mr. Harry is a
scamp: but luckily, we had for neighbour that good man, Mr. Dunstable. (<i>shouting to</i>
S<small>IMON</small>) Your friend Dunstable.</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. My wife will be——</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. (<i>interrupting him</i>) Yes, yes, I know! And when he learned
Mr. Harry’s conduct to my dear sister Jane, the idea occurred to him to send me here as a
companion to—“Go to their house,” he said, “you will see Mrs. Mitchell, not her husband,
he——”</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. My wife will be——</p>

nothing, but his wife——”</p>

marriage, and——”</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. Did you speak?</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. My wife will be back directly.</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. Poor old gentleman! his intellect appears quite shattered.
(<i>shouting</i>) I suppose you retire to rest very early?</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. (<i>without, in an assumed voice</i>) Very well, I shall find
her.</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. Oh, you know perfectly well, your friend, Mr. Dunstable.</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. Where are you, Mr. Sir? it’s me, Simon—you must wait upon
yourself—I’m going to bed.</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. (<i>aside</i>) Simon! the servant, ah, I understand. (<i>aloud,
to</i> S<small>IMON</small>) Oh, it is you, is it?</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. (<i>aside</i>) The young lady! (<i>dropping into easy chair and
acting the old man again</i>) My wife will be back directly—</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. (<i>pulling him from chair</i>) Yes; and Mr. Mitchell will also
be back directly.</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. (<i>frightened and placing the bottle on easy chair</i>) Mr.
Mitchell!</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. (<small>C</small>.) And I will tell him all!</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. (<i>on his knees</i>) Don’t! I shall lose my place, before I have
had time to redden my nose—’tisn’t my fault—it’s the keys of the cellar did it—and Mr.
Harry——</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. It was he who made you thus disguise yourself—confess and I
forgive you!</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. (<i>rising</i>) Yes; he arrived this evening, on a visit to his
grandfather and grandmother, whom he hasn’t seen for twelve years; and as they went away
this morning——</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. He hasn’t encountered them?</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. How was he to do it, I should like to know.</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. And you say that ’tis twelve years since——</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. Yes!</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. ’Tis well! now you go to the park gate, and you will ring as if
your mistress had returned.</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. My wife will be back directly—but as she is gone away——</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. No matter; obey me, or I tell all. (<i>door</i>,

Harry, we shall see! (<i>runs off, door</i>, <small>R</small>.—<i>shaking at door</i>,

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. (<i>going</i>) Yes, I’ll go to the park gate, and go to bed.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Be off!</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. For that matter, ma’am, who are you?</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. Who am I! you ask me that! Don’t you know I am the mistress of
this house?</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. (<i>aside</i>) My grandmother—phew! I should never have known
her.</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. And I should be glad to know what you are doing in my house at
this hour of the night.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. (<small>R</small>. <small>C</small>.) Well, the fact
is—(<i>aside</i>) The devil, though, I can’t tell her in this dress that I am her
grandson.</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. (<i>going up</i>) If you don’t answer, I shall call Simon to
bundle you out.</p>

are as old as the hills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Oh, no! but I have seen so much trouble.</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. And you are ugly—downright ugly.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Well, beauty is all a matter of opinion.</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. And look here, what is this? (<i>taking</i> F<small>RANK</small>

gracious goodness!</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. (<small>L</small>. <small>C</small>.) I was going to tell
you—it’s your grandson.</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. (<small>R</small>. <small>C</small>.) My grandson?</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Yes, Harry—he is here—and the pipe— (<i>aside</i>) I shall bolt.
(<i>aloud</i>) I will inform him of your arrival.</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. (<i>clutching his arm</i>) No, never mind, I shall see him
to-morrow. (<i>looking at him and starting</i>) Why, can I believe my eyes? that’s one of

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. You are a pretty companion—you are a thief.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. A thief!</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. Yes, one of the female swell mob. I’ll send Simon for the

grandmother, embrace your little grandson—let me kiss you, grandmother!</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. (<i>retreating</i>) No, no, certainly not.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Then you no longer love your little grandson?</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. You are a wicked boy.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Oh, grandmother!</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. Poor Jane!</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. (<i>aside</i>) Who is she, I wonder?</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. After having been so long engaged to marry her, everything
prepared, the wedding day fixed, all at once you write that you have altered your mind,
and don’t intend to marry yet awhile, leaving poor Jane to break her heart and die.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Really, I am very sorry for poor Jane—though, ’pon my soul, I
don’t know who she is.</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. You are Frank!</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. I am free to confess that I am, and the proof (<i>drawing papers
from his pocket</i>) see—no, that is my tailor’s bill; ’tis not at present receipted, but
I depend on your liberality, grandmother——</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. (<i>aside</i>) What does this mean?</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. (<i>finding letter that has been given him by</i>
S<small>IMON</small>) Yes, here it is; look at that; the letter which you wrote to me.
(<i>reading</i>) “My dear Frank,” you see, “your brother Harry is a bad fellow; tell him
from us that unless he becomes within a week, the husband of poor Jane, we have done with
him for ever.”</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. (<i>aside</i>) What do I hear?</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. “For yourself, if you wish that I should still love you——”
(<i>hugging</i> A<small>DELAIDE</small>) Oh, my dear grandmother.</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. There, there; that will do.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. “You will also get married.” Do you really wish to see me
married?</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. Well—I—that is——</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Well, grandmother, you won’t have to wait long; there is now in
this house a charming young creature, she arrived but this evening, yet——</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. (<i>astonished</i>) And it is she?</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Yes, grandmother.</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. You know her, then?</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Know her——</p>

<p class="entrance">S<small>IMON</small> <i>staggers on, door</i>, <small>L</small>.,

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. (<small>R</small>.) I know that, you fool, for here she is.</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. (<small>L</small>.) Oh, but I mean the real ’un.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. The what?</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. (<small>C</small>.) Can it be possible?</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. Godfather has just seen them; the old coach broke down, the roads
were so bad; so they have come back, and I was in the park, just going to
bed——(<i>staggering, and trying to pull off morning gown—Exit, door</i>
<small>C</small>.)</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. (<i>hastily snatching off her old woman’s dress</i>) Oh,

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Ah! you!</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. Let me go, for now that I know your brother will really marry my
sister——</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Poor Jane is your sister?</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. Jane Stirling, yes.</p>

you and I are bound to get married immediately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. What do you say?</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. The two weddings will make but one.</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. Well, by-and-bye, we shall see, perhaps. (<i>bell rings</i>)</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> S<small>IMON</small>, <small>L</small>., <i>door.</i></p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. (<i>down</i>, <small>L</small>.) There they are, do you hear
that?</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Simon, if you say a word about this night’s proceedings, I will
tell grandfather that you have been wearing his morning gown.</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. Oh, sir, it was you that——</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. (<i>crossing to</i> S<small>IMON</small>) And I will tell him you
were tipsy.</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. Oh, mum!</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. Now, let us prepare to receive them.</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. Yes.</p>

<p>S<small>IMON</small>. Oh, you needn’t be in a hurry, they don’t walk very fast, you
will have time to get married, and to ask pardon for all your sins.</p>

<p>A<small>DELA</small>. (<i>to</i> A<small>UDIENCE</small>) More indulgence is always
shewn to venerable age than is bestowed on giddy youth, and our great age, we think,
deserves your consideration.</p>

<p>F<small>RANK</small>. (<i>as old woman</i>) Think of my eighty years, and be good
children. Simon, ’tis now your turn to implore!</p>

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
